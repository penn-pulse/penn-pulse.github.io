The Problem

Cardiac arrest is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality. Each year in the U.S. alone, it affects approximately 300,000 adults in hospital and 250,000 out of hospital, with an average patient age of 66 years.  In-hospital cardiac arrest represents a true clinical emergency requiring immediate intervention to improve the chances of survival and intact neurologic functioning. Yet, only about 25% of patients survive to discharge.

Our Vision

Retrospective studies indicate that poor clinical monitoring is a primary cause of preventable deaths. Current monitoring systems in the ICU are unable to identify impending cardiac arrests despite post-hoc analysis by cardiologists revealing high-risk signs. Moreover, they suffer from false alarm rates of over 85%, leading to alarm fatigue.

To address this gap, we propose a cross-disciplinary initiative that combines advanced AI modeling with high-resolution, real-time, ECG data from patients admitted to the ICU. Our goal is to develop AI-driven models that provide timely, clinically actionable predictions while substantially reducing false alarms.


The potential for real-world impact is high: ICU systems already provide continuous multi-lead ECG monitoring; the high-frequency nature of these signals enables rapid response; and ECGs, being standardized and reflective of true physiological state, offer strong generalizability across patient populations.
